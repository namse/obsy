# The soak leg: hours-to-a-day of ingest + query + merge + retention on the
# 2 GiB rig (todo.md, "Next: production polish", item 1).
#
#   scripts/run_soak_local.sh <run-name>
#
# run_memprof_local.sh's rig — a native cgroup v2 scope, the bed's corpus and
# offered rate — pointed at what only hours can show: part-count growth against
# the unevictable sidecars, WAL size under the local-compaction policy, merge
# pacing, row-group-cache gauge drift over thousands of evictions, and
# allocator retention (the 1.34-1.69 anon/live ratio was measured at 60 s).
#
# What is deliberately different from the memprof script:
#
#   * The data directory lives on disk, not tmpfs. tmpfs pages are charged to
#     the writing cgroup as shmem and never reclaimed with swap off, so hours
#     of parts would eat the 2 GiB limit and manufacture an OOM the disk
#     engine does not have. The 240 s memprof runs fit under that; a soak
#     cannot.
#   * Retention is on (30 m period, 60 s interval, 5 m grace by default) so
#     parts are deleted, sidecars retract, and the disk reaches a steady state
#     the run can be judged on.
#   * All three signals, not one. The log leg is the rate; the metric leg
#     scrapes a live population onto the *same tenant* and reads it back
#     through the first-party metric routes. Metrics are the signal no long run
#     had ever touched, and the one whose storage changed most recently.
#   * An object store is configured by default (`file://` under the run's own
#     output directory). Without one the engine never offloads, never retires a
#     part to the store, and never compacts the WAL -- three production paths a
#     local-only soak silently skips. What `file://` cannot exercise is the
#     compare-and-swap: the code declares it a single-process development
#     backend and takes the overwrite path, so CAS stays a question only a real
#     provider's startup preflight answers.
#   * A disk guard fails the run before the root filesystem does.
#   * The verdict is a set of trends — quarter-by-quarter means — rather than
#     one peak: a soak passes when the residents stop growing, not when a
#     threshold survives a minute.
