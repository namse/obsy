//! The load harness.
//!
//! The one it replaces could not measure what it claimed to, and every number
//! it produced has been retired (`docs/LOAD_RESULTS.md`, retirement header;
//! `docs/VISION.md`, "The ruler comes before the work"). The defects it had
//! and what is done about each of them:
//!
//! * **One connection, one request in flight, `Connection: close`.** Now N
//!   keep-alive connections per workload, over the hand-rolled client in
//!   `http.rs`.
//! * **Uncorrected coordinated omission.** The pacer keeps a nominal schedule
//!   and the stopwatch now starts at the **intended** send. Both numbers are
//!   reported: service time from the actual send, response time from the
//!   intended one. The gap between them is the signal that the offered rate
//!   was not achievable, and it is exactly the signal the old harness deleted.
//! * **Cardinality 1 and near-zero entropy.** The corpus is
//!   `signy::corpus`, the same generator the benches measure.
//! * **Reads never contended with writes.** Queries are an independent
//!   workload with their own rate and their own connections.
//! * **Percentiles over eight samples.** Every percentile carries its sample
//!   count, and one the count cannot support is `null` with the reason.
//! * **RSS from a coarse `ps` poll.** `VmHWM` out of `/proc/<pid>/status`, and
//!   a sampled `VmRSS` series for the shape. A run that cannot read it fails.
//! * **`std::thread::sleep` inside `#[tokio::main]`.** Every wait is
//!   `tokio::time`.
