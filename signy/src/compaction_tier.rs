//! Which parts a compaction pass may rewrite together, shared by the log,
//! trace and metric compactors.
//!
//! **Only parts of comparable size compact together.** A tier is a size band,
//! each [`TIER_RATIO`] times as wide as the one below it, and a pass rewrites
//! one tier of one partition. The band that a part lands in is what bounds the
//! work: a tier's parts merge into one part of the tier above, so a byte is
//! rewritten once per tier it climbs — a logarithm of the partition's size,
//! not a function of how many flushes built it.
//!
//! The compactors this replaced grouped by a fixed ceiling instead: every part
//! under it was one tier. A partition's accumulated part stays under such a
//! ceiling for most of its life, so each pass rewrote the whole of it to
//! absorb a few flushes' worth of new rows, and the bytes written over a day
//! grew with the square of the bytes ingested. Production wrote 111 MB of
//! trace parts in seven hours to store about 1.5 MB of spans.
//!
//! **A partition nobody writes to any more still gets compacted.** Once no
//! part of a partition carries a row newer than [`IDLE_PARTITION_AGE`], a tier
//! of two parts is eligible however far it is from full, so a slow tenant's
//! partition does not keep a handful of parts open forever. The age is read
//! per partition rather than per tier on purpose: the upper tiers of a busy
//! partition hold data hours older than the flush that is landing now, and
//! compacting them for their age alone is the rewrite this module exists to
//! stop.
